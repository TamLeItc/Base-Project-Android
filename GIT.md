### Git Flow

    Do not commit to `master`/ `develop`

    branch `master` or `main` for release version, after release will tag release',
    branch 'develop' for delivery a build to QA/QC

    When creating a new project, the base code will be pushed to `master`
    Member needs to checkout to branch `develop`, then checkout to new branch `[feature name]` to do
    After completing the task, member makes a pull request to branch `develop` and assigns leader to review and merge source

    The merge from develop to master will be merged by leader after version pushlished store

    **Steps to develop a new app**
     1. Create a new project on the store
     2. Push base source to branch `master`
     3. Checkout new branch developer from master
     4. Checkout new branch `[feature name]` from developer
     5. Create merge request from feature branch into developer branch
     6. Leader will review source and approve when all task is clean

    Note: Leader should be check squash commits


    **Steps to update exist app**
     If the project does not have a developer branch, report it to the leader before starting work
